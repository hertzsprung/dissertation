There are two commonly-used vertical staggerings, the Lorenz grid \autocite{lorenz1960} and the Charney--Phillips grid \autocite{charney-phillips1953}, which offer different sets of computational and physical properties.

In both grids, horizontal velocities $u$ and $v$, and density $\rho$, are stored at full levels, and the vertical velocity, $w$, is stored at half levels.  The two grids differ in their placement of potential temperature, $\theta$: on the Charney--Phillips grid it is stored at half levels, and at full levels on the Lorenz grid.  These arrangements of variables are summarised in figure~\ref{fig:theory:staggering}.  The placement of thermodynamic variables leads to different representations of hydrostatic balance in simulations of flows involving buoyancy.

The Charney--Philips grid was originally developed for a quasigeostrophic model using sigma coordinates.  \textcite{arakawa-moorthi1988} found that advection of quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity is conserved by this grid staggering, and it requires less interpolation of variables than the Lorenz grid \autocite{holdaway2013}. \TODO{anything else of significant interest to say about it?}

The Lorenz grid has a number of desirable properties: it conserves total energy, the mean potential temperature, and variance of potential temperature assuming no diabatic processes or friction \autocite{arakawa-konor1996}.  However, it is known that a computational mode exists on the Lorenz grid which can create a zig-zag in the vertical distribution of potential temperature \parencites{arakawa-moorthi1988}{arakawa-konor1996}{holdaway2013b}.  This can be explained by considering the vertical momentum equation \autocite{holdaway2013}
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + \vect{u} \cdot \del w = -g - c_p \theta \frac{\partial \exner}{\partial z}
\end{align}
where $\vect{u}$ is the velocity field, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $c_p$ is the heat capacity of dry air at constant pressure, $\theta = T \left( p_0 / p \right)^\kappa$ is the potential temperature, $T$ is the temperature, $\exner = \left( p / p_0 \right)^\kappa$ is the Exner function of pressure, $p$ is the pressure, $p_0$ is a reference pressure, $\kappa = R/c_p$, and $R$ is the specific gas constant of dry air.

Open circles denote $\theta$ values interpolated onto half levels and the dotted line represents the interpolated profile.  Magnitude of $\theta$ increases to the right.}

In a discretisation of this equation, to calculate $w_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$, $\theta_{k+\frac{1}{2}}$ may be interpolated using an arithmetic mean of the adjacent values $\theta_k$ and $\theta_{k+1}$.  As shown in figure~\ref{fig:theory:theta-oscillation}, a grid-scale vertical wave in potential temperature would not be visible by the model \autocite{holdaway2013}.  Despite the oscillations, hydrostatic balance is satisfied and $w$ is everywhere zero.

The computational mode can affect the physical mode, causing spurious interactions with condensation processes \autocite{arakawa-konor1996} and the spurious generation of baroclinic instability and increased gravity wave activity \parencites{arakawa-moorthi1988}{cullen1997}.  The computational mode is not present on the Charney--Phillips grid.
