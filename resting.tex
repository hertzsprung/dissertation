\section{Resting atmosphere}
\label{sec:resting}

This two-dimensional test simulates a stably stratified atmosphere in hydrostatic balance.  Since there are no net forces, the analytical solution should remain at rest.  The test specification follows that from \textcite{klemp2011}.  \TODO{again, what is this designed to test?  Klemp says the horiz pressure gradient}

\subsection{Specification}
Following \textcite{weller-shahrokhi2014}, the domain is \SI{20}{\kilo\meter} wide and \SI{20}{\kilo\meter} high, which is narrower than \textcite{klemp2011} in order to reduce simulation time.  The wave-shaped mountain profile is taken from \textcite{schaer2002} where the surface height $h$ is given by
\begin{align}
\surface(x) = \surface_0 \exp \left( - \left( \frac{x}{a} \right)^2 \right) \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi x}{\lambda} \right)
\end{align}
where $a = \SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$ is the mountain half-width, $h_0 = \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}$ is the maximum mountain height and $\lambda = \SI{4}{\kilo\meter}$ is the wavelength.  For the SLEVE grid, the large-scale component $\surface_1$, described in section~\ref{sec:theory:sleve}, is specified as
\begin{align}
\surface_1(x) = \frac{1}{2} \surface_0 \exp \left( - \left( \frac{x}{a} \right)^2 \right)
\end{align}
and, following \cite{leuenberger2010}, $s_1 = \SI{4}{\kilo\meter}$ is the large scale height, $s_2 = \SI{1}{\kilo\meter}$ is the small scale height, and the optimal exponent value of $n = 1.35$ is used.

The initial thermodynamic conditions have a surface temperature of $\theta_0 = \SI{288}{\kelvin}$ and constant stability with Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N = \SI{0.01}{\per\second}$ everywhere, except for a more stable layer of $N = \SI{0.02}{\per\second}$ between $\SI{2}{\kilo\meter} \leq z \leq \SI{3}{\kilo\meter}$.

\subsection{Discretisation}
The simulation uses the discretisation of the fully-compressible Euler equations described in section~\ref{sec:method:discretisation}.  The domain is discretised on a grid having $40 \times 40$ cells such that $\Delta x = \Delta z = \SI{0.5}{\kilo\meter}$.  All boundary conditions are no slip.  The simulation is integrated forward by 5 hours with a timestep $\Delta t = \SI{100}{\second}$.  Unlike \textcite{klemp2011}, there is no eddy diffusion in our equation set.

Compared meshes, and dp/dx versus H operator.

\begin{itemize}
\item Max vertical velocities compared in Figure~\ref{fig:rest:w}
\item Energy change compared (see Figure~\ref{fig:rest:energy-tf}, \ref{fig:rest:energy-cut-cell})
\item H operator always outperforms dp/dx
\item All cut-cell style meshes outperform TF meshes in this test in terms of $w$ and energy change
\end{itemize}
Some issues were found:
\begin{itemize}
\item noOrography should have zero $w$, but actually has \SI{1e-10}{\meter\per\second}.  Hilary says this is due to loss of precision when reading initial fields (should be in discrete hydrostatic balance).
\item Computational oscillation in BTF H operator after about 4 hours (Figure~\ref{fig:rest:energy-tf})
\end{itemize}
