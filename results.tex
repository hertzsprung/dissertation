\chapter{Results}
Three test cases were performed over idealised terrain in two dimensions.  First, we report on the numerical errors associated with the horizontal advection of a scalar tracer.  Second, spurious flow and energy conservation are examined for a stable atmosphere initially at rest.  Third, \TODO{gravity waves...}  For each test, results on BTF, SLEVE and the cut cell style `SnapCol' grid are compared.  \TODO{any more?}
