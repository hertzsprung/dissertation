A variety of two-dimensional test cases were performed over idealised terrain, solving the linear advection equation and the compressible Euler equations.  The tests are designed to expose errors associated with both terrain following and cut cell grids.
For each test, results on the BTF, SLEVE, and the cut cell style `SnapCol' grid are compared.  Tests that use terrain following velocity fields omit results for the SLEVE grid.
