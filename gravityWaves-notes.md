gravity waves -- compare with other papers

from schaer2002:
"The gravity waves forced by this terrain have two domi-
nating spectral components: a larger-scale hydrostatic
wave that is characterized by deep vertical propagation,
and smaller-scale waves generated by the cosine-shaped
terrain variations and characterized by rapid decay with
height due to nonhydrostatic effects."

compare SLEVE with schaer?  is there much point when n = 1.35?
- for gravity waves, s1=5km, s2=2km in schaer2002
Klemp 2003
- contours every 5e-2 ms^-1
Not directly comparable with Zaengl 2012

- Hilary says small-scale gravity waves are evanescent

theory
======
When an air parcel is forced to rise over a mountain, it experiences a restoring buoyancy force which can create waves that propagate away from the mountain.  These are known as gravity waves, mountain waves, or lee waves.

- can cause lenticular clouds and rotor clouds
- large-amplitude GW can create clear air turbulence, aviation hazard
- large-amplitude GW can produce strong downslope winds


waves can be propogating or standing

propogating waves transport energy but not matter

waves have
- a wavenumber, related to wavelength
- phase speed, which is a function of wavenumber
- waves of different lengths, therefore, propogate at different speeds: dispersion relation
- group velocity

with background flow \overline{u}, dispersion relation: \nu = \overline{u}k \pm Nk / | \vect{k} | where \nu=frequency, k=horizontal wavenumber,k=wavenumber vector

assume rossby number is large, coriolis can be neglected

- flow over isolated ridge can be treated as sum of flows over infinite sinusoidal surfaces with different wavelengths
