pressure gradient errors

Mesinger 1988
- there is no solution to the error
- it is not truncation error: increasing vertical resolution is likely to increase the error, not reduce it
- "noncancellation of errors", Smagorinsky et al 1967
- (AIUI) in pressure coordinates, we calculate horizontal gradient on constant pressure surface, not constant height surface
- (don't really understand this bit) must have hydrostatic consistency: must use same formula to calculate slope of sigma surface, and to interpolate onto constant pressure surface
- even with hydrostatic consistency, errors are not always small over steep sigma surfaces

Mesinger 1982 (why does error increase with vertical resolution?)

Mahrer 1984
Best technique around (according to Mesinger 1988, and others TODO...)
