\chapter{Further work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cold, descending bubble to test large vertical momentum through the large faces of small cells.  We didn't see much effect of small cells in the gravityWaves test because the courant number isn't affected by flux through the small faces.
\item true cut cell mesh
\item cut cell mesh with merged cells (like \textcite{yamazaki-satomura2010})
\item Charney-Phillips staggering
\end{itemize}
