\chapter{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item cubicUpwindCPCFit tolerant of grid distortions, but suffers from diffusion in terrain following advection of tracer on SnapCol grid
\item SnapCol more accurate in horizontal advection, resting atmosphere
\item TF more accurate in TF tracer advection, gravityWaves
\item Lorentz computational mode excited by advection scheme errors on the SnapCol grid
\end{itemize}
