\chapter{Conclusions}
This project has compared BTF and SLEVE terrain following grids with a cut cell style grid by analysing the numerical errors of results from a finite volume model of the fully-compressible Euler equations across five, two-dimensional test cases.

\begin{itemize}
\item cubicUpwindCPCFit tolerant of grid distortions, but suffers from errors in terrain following advection of tracer on SnapCol grid
\item SnapCol more accurate in horizontal advection, resting atmosphere
\item TF more accurate in TF tracer advection, gravityWaves
\item Lorentz computational mode excited by advection scheme errors on the SnapCol grid
\end{itemize}
