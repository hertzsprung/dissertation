\section{Meshes}

Test cases run on the following meshes:
\begin{description}
\item[snap]{snappyHexMesh applied to unmodified blockMesh}
\item[snapOrtho]{snappyHexMesh applied to blockMesh modified with add2dMountain.  Points nearest the surface were moved vertically to meet the surface.  See comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:snap-mesh-compare}.  I haven't run any tests against this mesh (yet) though.}
\end{description}
