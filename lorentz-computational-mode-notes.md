explain lorentz/charney-phillips staggering
CP
- originally based in sigma coords, QG approximation
- conserves advection of QGPV 
- theta at levels carrying vertical mass flux, horizontal velocities in between
- vertical advection of theta depends solely on vertical mass flux

Lorenz
- vertically discrete balanced model
- conserves total energy, mean theta and variance of theta in adiabatic+frictionless processes
- horizontal velocity and potential temperature at same level, vertical mass flux in between
- computational mode in vertical distribution of theta (Tokioka 1978, Arakawa 1988, Cullen & James 1994, Hollingsworth 1995)
- with centred differencing, thickness between two adjacent layers depends on an average of the theta of the two layers


gravity waves theory -- how does flow over a mountain give rise to velocity and theta patterns?
