\section{Advection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Advection of tracer blob above orography (advection equation, not real dynamics)
\item No wind near ground, uniform zonal wind aloft
\item Compared meshes, and vanLeer versus tvdLimitedCubicUpwindCPCFit.  Compared against noOrography as a baseline.
\item Looked at l2 error norm at t=10000s by comparing with analytic tracer (created with setScalarOverOrography)
\item Cut-cell style meshes, unsurprisingly, same l2 error as noOrography
\item tvdLimitedCubicUpwindCPCFit slightly better than vanLeer, but much more computationally expensive
\end{itemize}
