\section{Grid construction}
Two dimensional, orthogonal grids were created using the OpenFOAM utility, \shellcmd{blockMesh}.  A custom utility was used to modify these orthogonal grids by moving $z$ coordinates to create terrain following grids.

At the time of writing, OpenFOAM does not support cartesian cut cell grids\footnote{An enhancement request was filed in 2013 to add support for cartesian cut cells to OpenFOAM, see \url{http://www.openfoam.org/mantisbt/view.php?id=1083}}.  Instead, the \shellcmd{snappyHexMesh} OpenFOAM utility was used to create a grid that approximates the cut cell method.
