\section{Gravity waves}

Gravity waves test taken from Weller and Shahrokhi.

\begin{itemize}
\item Reproduced result for BTF from W\&S
\item Vertical mixing at ground in lee of orography seen in results for snapCol and snap meshes.  This occurs in the lowest two rows of the mesh: lower layer $\theta$ is warmer, next layer above is cooler.  Feature is visible after t=3600s (Figure~\ref{fig:gw:mixing-3600s}), becomes more pronounced by t=18000s (Figure~\ref{fig:gw:mixing-18000s}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Investigation of vertical mixing}
Initially suspected mixing was due to computation mode of Lorenz vertical staggering but now it seems not:
\begin{itemize}
	\item plot UfDiff as a vector field doesn't seem to show any velocity anomalies in BTF or snalCol (Figure~\ref{fig:gw:ufdiff})
	\item plot of $\theta$ field shows that mixing is not strong enough to overcome stratification (Figure~\ref{fig:gw:theta})
	\item doubling mountain height causes mixing to appear in BTF case, and increases to three rows of mixing in SnapCol (Figure~\ref{fig:gw:double-height})
	\item halving $\Delta z$ also causes BTF mixing but less severe, also three rows of mixing in SnapCol (not shown)
	\item the results for dp/dx show mixing in BTF, and increased mixing in SnapCol (not shown)
\end{itemize}
Could also try changing stability (zN in environmentalProperties)
