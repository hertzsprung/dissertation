\section{Gravity waves}
\label{sec:gw}

Following \textcite{schaer2002}, uniform flow over an idealised two-dimensional mountain ridge induces gravity waves in a stable atmosphere.  As described in section~\ref{sec:theory:gw}, large-scale waves propagate away from the surface and small-scale evanescent waves decay rapidly above the terrain.

\subsection{Specification}
Following \textcite{melvin2010}, the domain is \SI{300}{\kilo\meter} wide and \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} high.  The mountain profile has the same form as equation~\ref{eqn:resting:mountain} but with a lower maximum height of $\surface_0 = \SI{250}{\meter}$.  As in the resting atmosphere test, $a = \SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$ is the mountain half-width and $\lambda = \SI{4}{\kilo\meter}$ is the wavelength.  On the optimised SLEVE grid, $s_1 = \SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$ is the large scale height, $s_2 = \SI{2}{\kilo\meter}$ is the small scale height and the optimal exponent value $n = 1.35$ as in the previous test.

The initial thermodynamic conditions have a surface temperature of $\theta_0 = \SI{288}{\kelvin}$ and constant stability with $N = \SI{0.01}{\per\second}$ everywhere.  A constant horizontal wind $u = \SI{10}{\meter\per\second}$ is prescribed at the inlet boundary.

\subsection{Discretisation}
The test uses the discretisation of the Euler equations described in section~\ref{sec:method:discretisation}.  The domain is discretised on a grid having $600 \times 100$ cells such that $\Delta x = \SI{0.5}{\kilo\meter}$ and $\Delta z = \SI{300}{\meter}$.  Sponge layers are added to the upper \SI{10}{\kilo\meter} and leftmost \SI{10}{\kilo\meter} at the inlet boundary to damp the reflection of waves.
The term $\mu \rho \vect{u}$ is subtracted from the momentum equation (equation~\ref{eqn:method:momentum}) where the damping function $\mu$ is adapted from \textcite{melvin2010} such that
\begin{align}
	\mu(x, z) &= \mu_\mathrm{upper} + \mu_\mathrm{inlet} \\
	\mu_\mathrm{upper}(z) &= \begin{cases}
		\overline{\mu} \sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{z - z_B}{H - z_B} \right) & \text{if } z \geq z_B \\
		0 & \text{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases} \\
	\mu_\mathrm{inlet}(x) &= \begin{cases}
		\overline{\mu} \sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{x_I - x}{x_I - x_0} \right) & \text{if } x < x_I \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\overline{\mu} = 1.2$ is the damping coefficient, $z_B = \SI{20}{\kilo\meter}$ is the bottom of the sponge layer, $H = \SI{30}{\kilo\meter}$ is the top of the domain, $x_0 = \SI{-150}{\kilo\meter}$ is the leftmost limit of the domain and $x_I = \SI{-140}{\kilo\meter}$ is the rightmost extent of the inlet sponge layer.  The sponge layer is only active on faces whose normal is vertical so that it damps vertical momentum only.

Note that, while the domain itself is \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} in height, for the purposes of generating of BTF and SLEVE grids, the domain height is set to \SI{20}{\kilo\meter} because the sponge layer occupies the uppermost \SI{10}{\kilo\meter}.

No slip conditions are imposed on the top and bottom boundaries and the outlet is zero gradient.  For Exner, hydrostatic balance is prescribed on all boundaries.  Following \textcite{melvin2010}, the simulation is integrated forward by 5 hours with a timestep $\Delta t = \SI{8}{\second}$.

Vertical velocity contours are every \SI{5e-2}{\meter\per\second} with solid lines denoting ascent and dashed lines descent.}
	\label{fig:gw:w}
\end{figure}

Comparing vertical velocity contours between BTF and SLEVE show few visible differences (figures~\ref{fig:gw:w:btf}, \subcaptionref{fig:gw:w:sleve}).  Evanescent waves are visible as dense contours immediately above the mountain ridges and the large-scale hydrostatic waves propagate vertically.  We verify the two wave types using the linear theory discussed in section~\ref{sec:theory:gw}.  The horizontal wavelength between each mountain peak is specified as $\lambda = \SI{4e3}{\meter}$, so $k = 2 \pi / \lambda \approx \SI{1.57e-3}{\per\meter}$.  The condition for evanescent waves is that $| \overline{u}k | \geq N$.  Since this test specifies $N = \SI{0.01}{\per\second}$ and $\overline{u} = \SI{10}{\meter\per\second}$, we find that the condition is satisfied.

The mountain half-width is specified to be $a = \SI{5e3}{\meter}$, so the large-scale wavelength is \SI{1e4}{\meter} and the horizontal wavenumber $k \approx \SI{6.28e-4}{\per\meter}$.  In this case, $| \overline{u}k | < N$, so waves propagate vertically.  Hence, we have shown that both propagating and evanescent waves are generated by this particular configuration of stability, wind speed, and mountain profile.

Since the same model was used, vertical velocities match those from \textcite{weller-shahrokhi2014}.  Vertical velocities on the SnapCol grid are similar to the terrain following results (figure~\ref{fig:gw:w:snapCol}).  All three results are in agreement with a semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian simulation from \textcite{melvin2010} (see figure~\ref{fig:gw:w:melvin}).

For the thermal advection test described in section~\ref{sec:wobblyThetaAdvection}, the terrain following velocity field is prescribed.  It is designed to imitate the velocity field of the gravity waves test, and is shown here on the BTF grid (\subcaptionref{fig:wobblyThetaAdvection:flow:btf}) and SnapCol grid (\subcaptionref{fig:wobblyThetaAdvection:flow:snapCol}).}

\end{figure}

Examining the velocity vector field we find that the flow is qualitatively similar between the BTF grid (figure~\ref{fig:gw:flow:btf}), SnapCol grid (figure~\ref{fig:gw:flow:snapCol}), and SLEVE grid (not shown).  Flow near the ground follows the terrain, accelerating as it passes over the mountain peaks, with velocities becoming more horizontal aloft.

\end{figure}

Potential temperature anomalies are similar on all grids, having a similar shape to vertical velocity contours (SLEVE grid figure~\ref{fig:gw:thetaDiff:sleve}, SnapCol grid figure~\ref{fig:gw:thetaDiff:snapCol}, BTF grid not shown).  As predicted by the gravity wave theory discussed in section~\ref{sec:theory:gw}, potential temperature and vertical velocity anomalies are out of phase by \ang{90}.

Examining more closely the potential temperature anomaly on the SnapCol grid, in the lee of the mountain the bottommost layer is anomalously warm and the layer above it is anomalously cold (figure~\ref{fig:gw:thetaDiffZoom:snapCol}).  Potential temperature increases with height because the simulated atmosphere is stable, so these anomalies serve to reduce the stability near the ground.  The anomalies are not sufficiently large to destabilise the atmosphere, however.   Therefore, vertical motion is not expected, and was not observed, near the ground on the lee side.   Whilst turbulent motion does cause thermal mixing in the real atmosphere, there is no viscosity in the model equations, so the thermal anomalies should not be present.  The feature is not present on the SLEVE grid (figure~\ref{fig:gw:thetaDiffZoom:sleve}) or BTF grid (not shown).

Figure~\ref{fig:gw:exner-theta} plots vertical profiles of Exner and potential temperature in the lowest \SI{1}{\kilo\meter} in the lee of the mountain at $x = \SI{50}{\kilo\meter}$.  The Exner function decreases linearly and is identical on BTF and SnapCol grids.  The potential temperature profile is linear on the BTF grid but a slight zig-zag is present on the SnapCol grid in the lowest two layers, corresponding to the warm and cold anomalies.  This profile shares the same shape as the example presented in figure~\ref{fig:theory:theta-oscillation}.
This implies that the computational mode of the Lorenz vertical staggering has been excited, because the zig-zag is present in the potential temperature profile, but not in the Exner profile.

Another test was performed in which the mountain height was doubled such that $\surface_0 = \SI{500}{\meter}$, with all other parameter values unchanged.  Overall potential temperature anomalies increase in magnitude because the gravity wave amplitude is larger, but these waves do not reach all the way to the ground.  In the lowest two layers, results on the SLEVE grid are similar for both mountain heights (see figures~\ref{fig:gw:thetaDiffZoom:sleve} and \ref{fig:gw:thetaDiffZoom:sleve-dh}).  On the SnapCol grid, the Lorenz computational mode is more severe.  Figure~\ref{fig:gw:exner-theta} also shows that potential temperature errors are no longer confined to the lowest two layers, but extend beyond \SI{1200}{\meter} above the ground.  Differences in potential temperature from the initial profile are summarised in table~\ref{tab:theta-sample}.

In section~\ref{sec:wobblyTracerAdvection}, we found that errors were largest when advecting a tracer over the SnapCol grid in a terrain following velocity field.  This suggests that the computational mode is excited by errors in the upwind-biased advection scheme.  A further experiment is presented in section~\ref{sec:wobblyThetaAdvection} to test this hypothesis.

The computational mode is manifested as a zig-zag in potential temperature on the SnapCol grid.  The double height mountain increases the severity of the computational mode, but has negligible effect on the SLEVE grid (not shown).

Little evidence of the `small cell' problem associated with cut cell grids, discussed in section~\ref{sec:theory:shaving}, was found on the SnapCol grid.  At each timestep, the maximum and mean Courant number for all cells in the grid was calculated.  Whilst initially larger on the SnapCol grid, the maximum Courant number eventually converges for all three grids (figure~\ref{fig:gw:courant:max}).  After 5 hours, the maximum Courant number gradually rises (not shown).  In figure~\ref{fig:gw:courant:mean}, we see that the mean Courant number is similar across all grids, but also increases slowly throughout the simulation.  It is likely that this is because the gravity waves are still amplifying, leading to a steady increase in wind speeds.

\begin{figure}

	\input{small-cell}
	\caption{Nearly-horizontal flow through a thin, rectangular cell in the $x-z$ plane.  Because the vertical velocity component is small, the cell height $\Delta z$ has a negligible effect on the two-dimensional Courant number.}
	\label{fig:gw:small-cell}
\end{figure}

The lack of evidence for the small cell problem be explained by considering flow through a two-dimensional, rectangular cell in the $x-z$ plane in which $\Delta x$ is several times larger than $\Delta z$ (figure~\ref{fig:gw:small-cell}).  Using equation~\ref{eqn:method:courant} and assuming a uniform flow $\vect{u} = ( u, 0, w )^\intercal$, the Courant number is
\begin{align}
	\courant &= \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x \Delta z} \left( u \Delta z + w \Delta x \right)
%
	\intertext{When the flow is almost horizontal, $u \gg w$, so}
%
	\courant &\approx \frac{u \Delta t}{\Delta x}
\end{align}
That is, the two-dimensional Courant number reduces to the one-dimensional Courant number.  Hence, the cell height $\Delta z$ has little effect on the CFL criterion.

In the gravity waves test, vertical motion is induced by the terrain and, for the shallow gradients used in this test, horizontal velocities dominate.
